Verbalize is an interactive language app that gives refugees and immigrants the confidence in tools they need to form strong connections with other people in their target language. Users can freely explore an interactive map and choose lesson modules based on their personal interests and needs. The app then allows users to apply their knowledge by integrating with the real world.
